Hi Stas:



  Below is a very positive review. Please attend to the comments and get me and Lisa a zippy file with all the source, data, and manuscript producing files so that she can begin the final formatting.



Best,

Joe

Hi Joe,

Here are my comments on Stas' article. In general, I was quite
impressed by the package that he has developed, and the article
does a great job of both outlining the conceptual issues that the
package is addressing (Section 1) and providing mostly clear
examples of how to use the package. The article would make for a
nice contribution to the journal, and the package a great
contribution to survey statisticians using Stata. My comments and
suggestions are mostly minor and revolve around clarification or
grammar. The most important substantive addition that would be
needed prior to publication is comment (5).

1. The Abstract should explicitly mention the name of the package (-ipfraking-).

[Done]

2. Remove "the" before "known control totals" on page 1.

[Done]

3. Remove "the" before "substantive interest" on page 1.

[Done]

4. When referring to population totals / means / etc. I would use
capital letters, but this is a minor comment. For example, on pages
1 and 2, I would use Y-bar, not y-bar.

[I went through the article and made changes where applicable.]

5. More important, the paper should make it clear (maybe in Section
1, or at the end) what unique advantages (speed / options /
trimming / ability to apply to replicate weights / etc.) this
package offers relative to the -ipfweight- package that Michael
Bergmann at Mannheim has already developed, and the -survwgt rake-
command that Nick Winter at Virginia has developed.

[I added a section 1.8 to discuss these. Nick Winter's is a great
package, and it does nearly everything that most users would ever
need. I was able to crash other packages a bit too easily by
supplying wrong weights or wrong combinations of targets and their
respective variables. I can't say that my package is bullet-proof
with respect to the user errors, but I think it handles them with
greater flexibility and robustness.]

6. Provide a brief definition of "informative sample designs" on
page 2 for the reader who may not be familiar with this concept.

[Done.]

7. Strike "tools" in the middle of page 3 before poststrata() and
postweight().

[I moved the word "options" upfront in that sentence. ]

8. Explicitly define x_j in equation (5).

[j is the observation index, x's are the control variables, as
defined on the line preceding the formula, and I introduced the
bold-faced vector notation more explicitly.]

9. I had to review the descriptions of the algorithms several times
before fully understanding the notation that was used. I would
suggest (on page 4, where the raking algorithm is first described)
spelling out the different steps for the reader. For example, after
step 1, say "That is, use the base weights to initialize the raked
weight." Related to this comment, make it clear why p is indicated
in the superscript in the first step. This may confuse readers, as
p refers to the number of control variables.

[ I added some comments in the body of the algorithm description. I
hope they help. ]

10. There are several places where "the" is omitted from sentences.
There are three instances in the second paragraph on page 6 alone
(before the names of the surveys, and before "hundreds of
thousands") and one instance before "weights" in the last paragraph
on page 6 (when describing the CV). There is an "a" omitted before
"practical perspective" at the bottom of page 6 as well. Hopefully
these grammar issues will be caught by an editor.

[ I will circulate the paper internally to see if better tech
writers than myself catch these. ]

11. Weight calibration does not always work to reduce non-response
errors (page 6); typical variables available for
post-stratification adjustments may be unrelated to response
propensity or key survey variables, depending on the survey. A more
balanced view of this argument should be presented. For example,
see Massey and Botman (1988, Telephone Survey Methodology) or
Biemer and Christ (2008, International Handbook in Survey
Methodology).

[ I don't have Massey & Botman (1988). I found Biemer & Christ
(2008) discussion to be somewhat limited. I think Bethlehem's work
to be more relevant, so I added some discussion of that. ]

12. Related to (9) above, spell out what is meant by the two weight
trimming steps in Step 6 on page 7. Readers may get stuck on the
notation.

[ Done ]

13. Give a brief example of the meta-data to which you are
referring on page 9.

[ These are the control variable names and categories -- text
added. ]

14. The coleq option on page 9 is not clearly described. Because
examples provided later show what the matrices should look like and
possible values for these parameters, at the very least refer to
one of the examples at this point. The same is true on page 10. It
would help a reader to see an example of these matrices.

[ This was kept terse intentionally, so that it is basically what
the help file provides. I did refer to the Examples section. ]

15. Page 12, "...pay attention to what the inputs look like, ..."
Also, "...an excerpt from the NHANES II data set ..."

[ Done ]

16. There are a couple of periods missing after the descriptions at
the top of page 12.

[ Done ]

17. In Example 1 (page 13), I would suggest adding some more text
explaining exactly what is being done in the formation of the
matrices, since the structure of the matrices is so important to
the command running smoothly.

[ I discuss the format of the matrix in a greater extent. ]

18. Page 14, provide an example of what you mean by "unusual
patterns" in the graphical output.

[ I have not tried to cook an artificial example, but I added some
text to describe what I mean by unusual. This is a matter of having
seen several dozen of such plots: some of them would look like any
other plot, while others would jump at you as somewhat odd. ]

19. Page 18, mention that the plots in Figure 2 are discussed in
more detail in the following section.

[ Done ]

20. Page 19, explain the arguments supplied to trimhiabs(),
trimloabs() and trimhirel() in detail.

[ Done. While working on this, I wanted to find a reference that
would describe how to deal with r() returned values, but did not
find anything in The Stata Journal. If the editor has any pointers,
that would be terrific. ]

21. The wording in the first paragraph on page 20 is quite
confusing. I think "not only" needs to be deleted, and impediment
needs to be changed to impede.

[ Rewrote ]

22. Page 23, "...from within bsweights (Kolenikov 2010), which can
pass..."

[ Done ]

23. Page 23, is rakedwgt2 the default name of the overall raked
weight produced by the command if no name is specified? Make this
clear...

[ rakedwgt2 is the weight that was produced in one of the previous
examples with the same raking settings as those in the current
bootstrap. Or rather the bootstrap weights are created with the
same settings as rakedwgt2. There is no default name, and ipfraking
will produce an error if it does not know what to do. See "one and
only one of generate() or replace must be specified" error message
in Section 4. ]

24. It would be nice to add an analysis at the end of Section 3
that examines estimates before and after raking the BRR weights,
just so that readers could see the full implementation, from weight
adjustment to estimation.

Again, this is a very nice article overall.

Dear Brady:

  I recently received as editor of the Stata Journal a submission by
Stanislav Kolenikov on "Calibrating survey data using iterative proportional
fitting (raking)", and I am hoping you could review it or suggest someone
who could. The submission email is below, a zip file with all relevant files
is attached, and you can look at the manuscript at

http://stat.tamu.edu/~jnewton/kolenikov_weight.pdf

Thanks very much,
Joe Newton

Dear Editor,

I apologize for the confusion. Please find attached the complete collection
which I hope includes everything now.
