# Stata ipfraking package

This package performs iterative proportional fitting, or raking, of survey weights.

The two important documentation files are the two Stata Journal papers:

* [ipfraking-v32.pdf](ipfraking-v32.pdf) _Iterative proportional fitting / raking_;
  the official reference is https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1536867X1401400104.
* [ipfraking-v87.pdf](ipfraking-v87.pdf) _Updates to the `ipfraking` ecosystem_;
  the official reference is https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1536867X19830912.

To install the package in Stata, type 

```
net from https://staskolenikov.net/stata
net describe ipfraking
net install ipfraking
```

although the version on that website is quite dated.
