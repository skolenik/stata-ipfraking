  abstract  = {This paper presents a general technique for the treatment
          of samples drawn without replacement from finite universes
          when unequal selection probabilities are used. Two sampling
          schemes are discussed in connection with the problem of
          determining optimum selection probabilities according to
          the information available in a supplementary variable.
          Admittedly, these two schemes have limited application.
          They should prove useful, however, for the first stage of
          sampling with multi-stage designs, since both permit
          unbiased estimation of the sampling variance without
          resorting to additional assumptions.}

          the variance of the post stratification estimator taken
          over all possible sample configurations appropriately
          weighted by the probability of occurrence. The generally
          accepted view is that, in most cases, the technique has
          little to offer over using the sample mean. This basis for
          evaluating the technique is questioned and the appropriate
          framework for statistical inference discussed. It is argued
          that inferences should be made conditional on the achieved
          sample configuration. The theory developed shows that
          neither the post stratification estimator nor the sample
          mean is uniformly best in all situations but empirical
          investigations indicate that post stratification offers
          protection against unfavourable sample configurations and
          should be viewed as a robust technique.}
